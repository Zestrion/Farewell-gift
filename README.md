# Farewell-gift
To add your own message:
1. Make whatever you want into a self-contained prefab that can be loaded and deleted.
2. Either make space in the top-right corner for a button or leave it to me (Tomas S.) to handle placing it elsewhere. This button is a universal Next/Return button.
3. Add the MessageData script to the highest parent of the prefab and set the Author name(s).
4. Add the prefab into the Prefabs list in the GameManager script under the Canvas object (or just leave it me).

Note: Would be a good idea to make sure that the message appears fine regardless of aspect ratio.
